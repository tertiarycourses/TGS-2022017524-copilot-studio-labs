# 🚨 Mission 01: Get started with the Hiring Agent

## 🕵️‍♂️ CODENAME: `OPERATION TALENT SCOUT`

> **⏱️ Operation Time Window:** `~45 minutes`

## 🎯 Mission Brief

Welcome, Agent. Your first assignment is **Operation Talent Scout** - establishing the foundational infrastructure for an AI-powered recruitment system that will transform how organizations identify and hire top talent.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to deploy and configure a comprehensive hiring management system using Microsoft Copilot Studio. You'll import a pre-built solution containing all the necessary data structures, then create your first AI agent - the **Hiring Agent** - which will serve as the central orchestrator for all future recruitment operations.

This initial deployment establishes the solution that you'll enhance throughout the Agent Academy Operative course. Consider this your base of operations - the foundation upon which you'll build an entire network of specialized agents in subsequent missions.

## 🔎 Objectives

In this mission, you'll learn:

1. About the scenario and gain comprehensive knowledge of hiring automation challenges and solutions
1. How to successfully import and configure the fundamentals of a hiring management system
1. How to build a hiring agent that is the start of the scenario you're going to build as an Agent Academy Operative

## 🔍 Prerequisites

Before embarking on this mission, ensure you have:

- Copilot Studio license
- Access to a Microsoft Power Platform environment
- Administrative permissions to create solutions and agents

> [!TIP] Prerequisites help:
> If you need help getting a Copilot Studio license, please reference the [Recruit Course Setup lab](./../../recruit/00-course-setup/index.md) which walks you through setting up a Power Platform environment with a Copilot Studio trial.

## 🏢 Understanding the Hiring Automation Scenario

This scenario demonstrates how a company can use Microsoft Copilot Studio full to improve and automate its hiring process. It introduces a system of agents that work together to handle tasks like reviewing resumes, recommending job roles, preparing interview materials, and evaluating candidates.

### Business Value

The solution helps HR teams save time and make better decisions by:

- Automatically processing resumes received via email.
- Suggesting suitable job roles based on candidate profiles.
- Creating job applications and interview guides tailored to each candidate.
- Ensuring fair and compliant hiring practices through built-in safety and moderation features.
- Collecting feedback to improve the solution.

### How It Works

- A central **Hiring Agent** coordinates the process and stores data in Microsoft Dataverse.
- An **Application Intake Agent** reads resumes and creates job applications.
- An **Interview Prep Agent** generates interview questions and documents based on the candidate's background.
- The system can be published to a demo website, allowing stakeholders to interact with it.

This scenario is ideal for organizations looking to modernize their recruitment workflows using AI-powered automation, while maintaining transparency, fairness, and efficiency.

## 🧪 Lab 1: Setup the Hiring Agent

In this hands-on lab, you'll establish the foundation for your hiring automation system. You'll begin by importing a pre-configured solution that contains all the necessary Dataverse tables and data structure for managing candidates, job positions, and hiring workflows. Next, you'll populate these tables with sample data that will support your learning throughout this module and provide realistic scenarios for testing. Finally, you'll create the Hiring Agent in Copilot Studio, setting up the basic conversational interface that will serve as the cornerstone for all the other features you'll add in future missions.
