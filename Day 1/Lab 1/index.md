# Lab 1: Introduction to Agents

## Lab Title
Introduction to Agents - Understanding AI Foundations

## Lab Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
1. Understand what conversational AI is and how it works
2. Explain how Large Language Models (LLMs) power chat experiences
3. Describe Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its benefits
4. Differentiate between conversational agents and autonomous agents
5. Understand how agents in Copilot Studio leverage these concepts

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of AI concepts
- Interest in building conversational AI solutions
- No coding experience required

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Understanding Conversational AI (~5 minutes)
1. Review the definition of conversational AI
2. Explore examples of conversational AI in everyday applications
3. Understand the role of natural language processing

### Step 2: Learning About Large Language Models (~10 minutes)
1. Understand what LLMs are and how they're trained
2. Learn about tokenization and context windows
3. Explore the concept of prompting
4. Recognize that LLMs predict the "next best word"

### Step 3: Exploring RAG (~10 minutes)
1. Understand the limitations of static LLM training data
2. Learn the RAG workflow: Query → Retrieve → Augment → Generate
3. Explore how RAG enables real-time knowledge integration
4. Understand grounding and citation in responses

### Step 4: Comparing Agent Types (~5 minutes)
1. Define conversational agents and their characteristics
2. Define autonomous agents and their capabilities
3. Understand when to use each type
4. Review real-world examples of both types

### Step 5: Copilot Studio Overview (~5 minutes)
1. Explore the Visual Agent Designer
2. Understand model selection options
3. Learn about knowledge integration
4. Review publishing and distribution options

## Duration
~30 minutes (intel only, no fieldwork required)
