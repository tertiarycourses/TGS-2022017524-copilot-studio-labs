# Lab 2: Copilot Studio Fundamentals

## Lab Title
Copilot Studio Fundamentals - The Four Building Blocks

## Lab Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
1. Understand what Copilot Studio is and when to use it
2. Explain the four building blocks: Knowledge, Tools, Topics, and Instructions
3. Describe how these components work together with the orchestrator
4. Design basic agent architectures using these building blocks
5. Understand how generative orchestration enables intelligent routing

## Prerequisites
- Completed Lab 1: Introduction to Agents
- Basic understanding of AI concepts
- No coding experience required

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Understanding Agents in Copilot Studio (~5 minutes)
1. Define what an agent is in the Copilot Studio context
2. Understand the difference between general-purpose chatbots and custom agents
3. Review use cases for custom agents:
   - Company-specific knowledge
   - Real-world task execution
   - Conversational context maintenance

### Step 2: When to Use Copilot Studio (~5 minutes)
1. Identify scenarios requiring multiple knowledge sources
2. Understand multi-step workflow automation needs
3. Explore in-tool contextual experiences
4. Compare with Microsoft 365 Copilot capabilities

### Step 3: Building Block 1 - Knowledge (~5 minutes)
1. Understand custom instructions and context
2. Explore knowledge sources (grounding data):
   - SharePoint libraries
   - Documentation sites
   - Wikis and databases
3. Learn about conversation memory and context retention

### Step 4: Building Block 2 - Tools (Actions) (~5 minutes)
1. Define what tools/actions are
2. Explore types of actions:
   - Send email/Teams message
   - Create/update calendar events
   - Database operations
   - Power Automate flows
   - REST API calls
3. Understand input/output definitions

### Step 5: Building Block 3 - Topics (~5 minutes)
1. Understand conversational triggers and entry points
2. Learn about topic descriptions for AI routing
3. Explore how topics map to actions
4. Review generative orchestration for topic selection

### Step 6: Building Block 4 - Instructions (~5 minutes)
1. Define role and persona for your agent
2. Set response guidelines and rules
3. Configure memory and context rules
4. Understand prompt engineering basics

### Step 7: How It All Works Together (~5 minutes)
1. Review the orchestration flow
2. Understand the sequence: Topic → Instructions → Knowledge → Tools
3. Explore the visual flow diagram
4. Practice identifying component interactions

## Duration
~30 minutes (intel only, no fieldwork required)
